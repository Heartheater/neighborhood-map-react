# Neighborhood Map
This is an app using Google Maps and React that shows you a section of a neighborhood and information about restaurants near it. 
<br>
Click on a restaurant from the list in the sidebar or one of the map markers to view more information about the specific restaurant.

You can also use the filter located in the sidebar to filter restaurants from the list. Filter either by typing in the name of the restaurant you want or by typing in the type of restaurant you want (e.g. typing in "Thai" will show you Thai Restaurants)
